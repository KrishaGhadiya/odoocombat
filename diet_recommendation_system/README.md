# Diet Recommendation System

## Overview

Creating a diet recommendation system is a project aimed at providing personalized nutrition plans to users based on their health goals, dietary preferences, and nutritional needs. This system integrates user authentication, profile management, personalized diet planning, and a comprehensive nutritional database to facilitate informed dietary choices.

## Core Features

### 1. User Authentication and Authorization

- **Secure Login System**: Users and admins can securely log in to access the system.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Ensures data privacy and security by granting appropriate access rights based on user roles.

### 2. User Profile Management

- **Detailed User Profiles**: Includes information such as age, gender, weight, height, dietary preferences, allergies, and health goals.
- **Update Personal Information**: Users can update their profile details and health metrics as needed.

### 3. Personalized Diet Plans

- **Customized Meal Plans**: Generates personalized meal plans tailored to individual user profiles and dietary preferences.
- **Frequency Options**: Offers daily, weekly, and monthly meal suggestions to accommodate different planning preferences.
- **Nutrient Breakdown**: Provides detailed breakdowns of calories, macronutrients (protein, fat, carbs), and micronutrients (vitamins, minerals) for each meal plan.

### 4. Nutritional Database

- **Comprehensive Food Database**: Contains a wide range of foods with detailed nutritional information.
- **Search and Filter Functionality**: Enables users to search for specific foods or recipes based on nutritional content or dietary requirements.

## Screens

The project includes the following screens:

1. **Login Screen**: Allows users and admins to securely log in to the system.
2. **User Profile Screen**: Displays and allows editing of user profile information and health metrics.
3. **Diet Plan Screen**: Shows personalized meal plans with nutritional breakdowns for different timeframes (daily, weekly, monthly).
4. **Food Database Screen**: Provides a searchable interface for exploring a comprehensive nutritional database.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Python, Flask framework
- **Database**: SQLite for storing user data and nutritional information
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for building user interfaces
- **Security**: Werkzeug for password hashing, role-based access control implementation
- **Dependencies Management**: Conda environment for package management
